1. Add pipeline support for ConvertFrom-VBOLog
   Get-Content -Path <some  log file> | ConvertFrom-VBOLog

2. We have ConvertFrom-VBOLog which works well.  We could use additional parsers for the different type of jobs.
   Some of the other logs have parsable fields 

3. I need for Veeam Backup and Replication like I have to VBO - ConvertFrom-VBRLog.

4. Re-write SPOCustomScripts as a module and switch from SharePoint module to 
   Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
